# React + TypeScript + Vite 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Mock Service Worker (MSW) in React 

This project sets up Mock Service Worker (MSW) in a React application to mock API requests. MSW intercepts network requests made by the application and returns pre-defined responses, allowing developers to test and debug their code without needing to rely on a real backend. It is especially useful in development, testing, and CI environments.
